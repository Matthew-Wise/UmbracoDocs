# Organization Login Providers
{% hint style="info" %}
This is a Beta feature and currently only open to a few early testers. If you want to help test the feature, get in touch somehow [TODO: describe how]...
{% endhint %}

The External Login Providers feature in Umbraco Cloud allows you to integrate third-party authentication systems to manage Portal user logins securely and efficiently. This functionality is especially useful for teams that want to simplify login management or use their existing identity systems.

Using OpenID Connect, Umbraco Cloud supports external login providers such as Microsoft Entra ID, Auth0, Google, and so on. This feature helps administrators manage backoffice access, assign user roles, and improve security.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is exclusively for Cloud Portal access and access to Project features only available within the portal. [You can see how to set up External Login Providers for the Backoffice on Cloud Projects in this article](../../../project-features/external-login-providers.md).
{% endhint %}

## External Login Providers

{% hint style="info" %}
The Organization Areas is only available for user logged in with Umbraco Id. Additionally the Login Providers Section can only be accessed by user with Admin rights to the Organization.
{% endhint %}

This guide shows you how to set up and configure external login providers for your Cloud projects. It includes the following steps:

- [Prepare your Login Provider](#prepare-your-login-provider)

- [Register the Login Provider in Cloud Portal](#register-the-login-provider-in-cloud-portal)

### Prepare your Login Provider

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Microsoft Entra ID" %}
1. Access the Microsoft Azure Portal.
2. Locate the Microsoft Entra ID and enter your tenant.
3. Select **Add**.

![Select Add and then choose App Registration to start registering your app](../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/project-settings/images/elp-azure-2.png)

* **Authority URL** - available from **Endpoints** on the **Overview** page.
* **Secret ID** - needs to be generated on the **Certificates & Secrets** page.

If you're working with an enterprise or a custom setup, ensure the email claim is included in the ID token configuration.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Auth0" %}
1. Access your Auth0 dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Applications**.

### How to fill in the External Login Provider Configuration
Learn about what type of data and information you need for each field in the configuration form.

**Display Name**

A Friendly name for the Login Provider

**Alias (required)** 

A unique alias for the provider in the Organization. 
Use only lower-case. 
Spaces are not allowed. 

**Client Id (required)** 

A unique Client ID generated in the external login provider.Entra ID: Guid<br>Auth0: Random characters<br>Google: <code>{randomchars}.apps.googleusercontent.com</code>


**Client Secret (required)** 

A secret that is generated in the External Login Provider and is associated with the Client Id.


**Authority (required)** 

The URL for the External Login Provider. This can be found in the External Login Provider.


Entra ID: <code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/&#x3C;Directory (tenant)></code><br>Auth0: <code>https://{accountId}.uk.auth0.com</code><br>Google: <code>https://accounts.google.com</code>


**Metadata Address**

If you need a special metadata address for your External Login Provider, you can set it here. By default, the system will resolve the metadata address from the Authority Url, which is why this property is optional.

A common scenario for using a special metadata address is when working with Entra ID and configuring claims mapping. In this case, you must set the metadata address to the following:<code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid={client-id}</code>

**User Mapping Claim Name**

Your provider may assign users to specific roles (For example: Admin, Editor, Viewer).<br><br>The <strong>User Group Claim Name</strong> is the field in the authentication token (claim) that identifies these roles. The system reads this claim to determine a userâ€™s permissions.

Example: If your provider sends roles in a claim named <code>user_roles</code>, you would set the <strong>User Group Claim Name</strong> to <code>user_roles</code> so the system can properly recognize user permissions.



## Project Configurations

Here you will setup access to Project in the Portal while signed in with your Login Provider.

You will need to add a Project Configuration per Project and per Login Provider. It is not required to add Project Configurations to all project. Projects without a Project Configuration tied to a Login Provider will not be shown to user logged in with that particular Login Provider.  

When setting up a Project Configuration first select a Project in the left side of the screen. Next click on "+ Add" on the Login Provider you want to add a Project Configuration for.

The modal has the following fields:
- Default Access Level (required)
- No Claim Found Behavior (required)
- User Mapping Claim Name
- Project User Mappings
  - Consists of two fields: "Provider Role Value" and "Project Access Level"

### Default Access Level
Select the level of access you want users signing in with the External Login Provider to get for this Project.
The dropdown has two possible permissions:
- Read Only
- Read and Write

This value is meant to be a fallback value and can be overwritten by "Project User Mappings" setting.
If there are no Mappings available for the user the "No Claim Found Behavior" setting will evaluate if this fallback Permissions is used or "NoAccess".

### No Claim Found Behavior
Use this setting for more fine grained control.
This will allow you to use the Role Claim in you Login Provider to assign Permissions to your users.
 
The setting has two Settings:
- NoAccess
- Use Default Access Level

When `NoAccess` is selected it will block the users access to the Project if they do not have the correct Role assigned. 
If you decide to use the more lenient option "Use Default Access Level", all users in your Login Provider will automatic get the permission you selected in "Default Access Level". Unless they have a hit on the Project User Mappings.

### User Mapping Claim Name
Enter the name of your providers default or custom Role claim name. 

### Project User Mappings
Here you can set up mapping between the "Provider Role Value" and the Project Permission Level.

## Audit

Use Audit section to troubleshoot your Login Providers and keep an eye on user Sign-ins.

There is audit log for each Login Provider. Keep in mind that if you remove the Login Provider the audit log will also disappear. 

We are listing the following types of audit:

| Type | Sub-Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| User Sign-ins | - | See information about Project Permissions evaluated at the Sign-in. |
| External Login Providers | Added and Updated | Entries includes the changed properties. The Client Secret is always redacted. |
| Project Configuration | Added, Updated and Deleted | Shows information on the changed properties and stored Role mapping options |
